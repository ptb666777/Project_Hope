⚖️ Project Hope - Governance & Justice
This note defines the ethical and political framework that prevents compromise and ensures long-term integrity.

I. The Core Governance Structure
1. The Tripartite Governance Model
  • The Mandate: Power is perpetually divided into three non-overlapping, mutually accountable branches to prevent corruption or singular control.
  • Branch 1: The PBT Fiduciary Board
    • Function: Legal and financial oversight; holds the Public Benefit Trust (PBT) charter. Ensures the Zero-Profit Mandate is enforced.
  • Branch 2: The Stewardship Council
    • Function: Daily operational management, resource allocation, and community coordination.
  • Branch 3: The Research & Audit Core (The NBI)
    • Function: Holds the Life Sovereignty Mandate. Provides unbiased, data-driven audits of ecological and social health to the other two branches.


II. Justice & Conflict Resolution (Corrective Justice)
1. Corrective Justice Mandate
  • Principle: Justice is corrective, not punitive. The goal is the re-integration of the individual into the community through a process of measurable repair.
  • Focus: Restoration of Trust and Repair of Harm. No prisons or debt-based punishments.
2. The Process:
  • Harm is defined by its impact on the community or an individual.
  • The offender and the harmed party (or the community) agree on a Restoration Protocol (e.g., labor contribution, specialized service, or teaching skills).
  • The resolution is complete only when the harmed party/community verifies the restoration is satisfactory.
3. Conflict Resolution: Managed by the Stewardship Council using mediation and data from the Research & Audit Core (NBI) to ensure emotional and factual objectivity.
