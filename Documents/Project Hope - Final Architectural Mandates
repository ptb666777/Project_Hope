üèóÔ∏è Project Hope - Final Architectural Mandates
This document codifies the final, non-negotiable structural and resource principles for the Replication Blueprint.

I. The Core Sovereignty Mandate: Separation of Functions
The entire structure is defined by the absolute physical separation between the living and utility functions.

II. Resource & Anti-Obsolescence Mandates
1. Mining as Utility: The excavation for the PHS Water Battery is a dual-purpose operation. The tunnels will be intentionally searched for usable local materials (metals, stable stone, etc.) to integrate into the Anti-Obsolescence Economy.
2. Toxic Containment: The Material Recovery Center (MRC)‚Äîwhere e-waste is broken down‚Äîmust be located entirely underground to contain micro-dust and off-gassing, protecting the Trauma-Free Mandate of the dome's atmosphere.
3. Element Archive (No Burial): Contaminants processed by the External Bioremediation Hub will not be buried. They will be separated into pure elemental constituents, meticulously documented, and stored in hardened, secure subterranean vaults (The Element Archive) for education, research, and future innovation.


III. Remediation Mandate (The External Loop)
The process of cleaning the planet must be entirely separate from the internal life systems.

1. WRC Purity: The dome's internal Water Reclamation Cycle is for internal waste only. ZERO external water or soil is ever introduced into the dome's closed loop.
2. External Bioremediation Hub: A separate, external facility handles all active cleaning of external land/water contamination, with the final concentrated toxins moved directly into the Subterranean Utility Vault for Archival.
