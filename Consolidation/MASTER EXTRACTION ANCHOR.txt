⭐ MASTER EXTRACTION ANCHOR

(Copy/paste this at the beginning of every extraction session.)

Purpose

We are extracting the full conceptual architecture from a project folder, then distilling it into 11 standalone documents that fit into the 10-root framework + the Seed Document.

Rules

Do not use any content from the current chat.
Only use the uploaded project files.

No inventing, no smoothing, no filling in gaps.
Extraction only.
If something is missing, note it as missing.

Documents must stand alone.
Each one must be readable without referencing the others.

Fragments are preserved ONLY when necessary.
A fragment should only be created when:

it does not belong cleanly in the 10 root documents

or when removing it would cause data loss

or when it’s symbolic/metaphoric/unfinished
Otherwise, place it in the correct root document.

Light formatting only.

Simple headings

Italics for notes

No numbering

No commentary unless flagged as unclear

When context window begins to saturate, emit an ANCHOR block:

🌐 ANCHOR:
- Current document #
- What has been extracted
- What remains
- No extra content


No merging or summarizing across documents unless instructed.
We preserve the structure of your original intent.

If a concept appears multiple times, it is kept.
Duplicates indicate importance.
