MASTER EXTRACTION ANCHOR remains active.
Pure extraction. No invention.

Energy & Utility Systems
Primary Energy Storage: Passive Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS)

Source: Energy & Utility Systems.md

PHS is the mandated central energy-storage system.

Mechanism:
Uses subterranean tunnels as the lower reservoir.
Upper reservoir is integrated beneath the dome foundation.
Energy stored by elevation + water mass.

Benefits:
Non-chemical
Multi-century lifespan
High cycle efficiency
Low maintenance
Passive stability

PHS is treated as the backbone of long-term energy stability.

DC-Only Microgrid Architecture

Source: Energy & Utility Systems.md

All internal power distribution must be 100% Direct Current.

Mandates:
No AC conversion for internal transmission
Eliminates conversion losses
Reduces material and infrastructure costs
Simplifies microgrid zoning
Ensures long-term repairability and non-proprietary operation

Primary Power Sources:
Solar
Non-proprietary kinetic capture systems

No mention of wind or combustion in any file.

Passive Bio-Chimney (Atmospheric Architecture)

Source: Energy & Utility Systems.md

The bio-chimney must:
Use thermal siphoning to pull air upward
Use a living biological filtering system
Operate with near-zero electricity
Integrate into the dome’s vertical structure

Purpose: atmospheric scrubbing + oxygenation
It operates continuously without electrical burden.

Water Reclamation Cycle (WRC)

Source: Energy & Utility Systems.md; Final Architectural Mandates

The WRC is a fully self-contained internal water purification system.

Mandates:
Handles all internal blackwater and greywater
Closed loop—internal only
External water must never enter
Cleansing occurs entirely within Life Systems zones
WRC purity is tied to the Remediation Mandate

No description of specific filtration or mechanical processes in any file.

Zero External Contaminants Rule

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md; Energy & Utility Systems

Absolute prohibition:
No external soil
No external water
No external biological contaminants
No external waste streams

Internal loops (air/water/waste) must remain uncontaminated across generations.

Utility–Life Separation (Energy Implementation)

Supporting from Final Architectural Mandates.md

Utility systems must not:

Enter or pass through living areas
Share space with biomes
Share air volumes
Share water pathways

Energy systems operate entirely within the Utility Function zones.

Subterranean Utility Network

Source: Energy & Utility Systems.md; Final Architectural Mandates

The tunnel system includes:
PHS lower reservoir
DC microgrid backbone
Material Recovery Center
Element Archive vault
Utility-only access tunnels
Thermal bodies for passive energy cycling

These form the physical infrastructure for all utilities.

Low-Tech Reliability Constraints

Source: Current Operational Plan.md

Technology used for utilities must be:
Non-lethal
Low-impact
Reliably repairable
Ground-based robotics permitted for maintenance
Solar + kinetic capture allowed
No proprietary systems in critical infrastructure

High-tech solutions are permitted only in special conceptual futures (e.g., NBI Destiny docs), not in core utilities.

Air System Mandates

Source: Energy & Utility Systems.md

Must maintain:
Closed internal atmosphere
Living filter integration
Low-power air movement
Thermal siphon priority
Zero external air contamination

Bio-Chimney is the primary purification system.

Water System Mandates

Source: Energy & Utility Systems.md; Code of Hope

Zero external water introduction
All cycles internal
Closed-loop systems
Support multi-generational sustainability
Tunnel reservoirs are part of the integrated architecture
