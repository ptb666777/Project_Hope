MASTER EXTRACTION ANCHOR remains active.
Pure extraction. No invention. No smoothing.

Anti-Obsolescence & External Ecology Systems
Anti-Obsolescence Mandate (Structural Principle)

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md

All operations, materials, and architecture must obey anti-obsolescence rules:

• Use local materials mined during PHS excavation
• Materials must be stable, durable, and generational
• Components must be repairable
• Avoid proprietary systems
• Promote modular replacement
• Design for centuries-scale lifespan

The excavation itself is a resource operation, feeding the anti-obsolescence economy.

Material Recovery Center (MRC)

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md

Location:
Entirely underground.

Purpose:
• Break down e-waste
• Contain toxic micro-dust
• Manage off-gassing
• Process hazardous materials
• Prepare contaminants for Element Archive

Mandates:
No toxic activity inside living or biome zones.
No atmospheric crossover into Life Systems.

Element Archive (No Burial Law)

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md

Contaminants processed by the external cleanup hub must be:

• Fully separated into pure elemental constituents
• Documented meticulously
• Stored in hardened subterranean vaults (The Element Archive)
• Accessible for education and future research

Burial of contaminants is forbidden.

This creates long-term ecological accountability across generations.

Zero Burial Mandate (Ecological Law)

Source: Code of Hope; Final Architectural Mandates

Toxins and contaminants must not be buried, diluted, or hidden.

They must undergo:

• Complete separation
• Cataloging
• Archival storage

This protocol replaces standard global waste practices.

External Bioremediation Hub (The External Loop)

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md

All remediation of external ecosystems must be conducted outside the dome:

• Soil cleanup
• Water cleanup
• Toxin extraction
• Chemical remediation
• Biological restoration

Final concentrated toxins are moved directly into the Element Archive.

The internal WRC cannot interact with any external material.

WRC Purity Mandate (Separation of Internal & External Systems)

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md; Energy & Utility Systems.md

Internal water reclamation:

• Handles internal waste only
• Must remain uncontaminated
• No external water ever introduced
• No external soil enters the system

This mandate preserves internal biomes, psychological safety, and closed-loop design.

Ecological Balance Mandate

Source: Code of Hope (Legal Compendium)

The community must actively maintain ecological balance.

Key mandates:

Fauna Management
• Absolutely no lethal population control
• Use non-lethal, indirect methods (e.g., food-source management)
• Strategic relocation permitted
• Predators only “harvested” if ill, diseased, or weakened

Flora Management
• Removal of non-native plants only after checking conservation databases
• Representative seed sample must be preserved
• Non-native tree removal requires council approval

Interconnected Ecosystem Clause
The ecosystem is recognized as a living, communicative entity.

Baseline Survey Mandate

Source: Code of Hope; Governance & Justice; Architectural Mandates

Before any ecological action:

A meticulous survey of flora and fauna must be conducted and archived.

Survey determines:

• What to protect
• What to restore
• What to relocate
• What to remove
• Seasonal and lifecycle considerations
• Inter-species dependencies

This defines ecological intervention as an evidence-based process.

Wildlife & Food Protocols

Source: Code of Hope

Mandate of the Predator
Harvesting an animal is only permitted when:

• animal is ill
• animal is diseased
• animal is weakened

Community acts as a “cleaner,” not a hunter.

Healthy populations may not be culled.

External Ecology Operating Model

Source: Final Architectural Mandates; Energy Systems; Code of Hope

External systems include:

• External water/soil remediation
• External toxin concentration
• Rewilding operations
• Ecological monitoring
• Climate stewardship roles
• Integration with external biomes without internal contamination

All external work feeds the Element Archive and Baseline Survey archives.

Internal vs External Ecology (Strict Separation)

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md

Internal Ecology:
• Closed-loop
• Contaminant-free
• Psychological safety mandate
• Regenerative biomes
• Educational environment
• No external exchange

External Ecology:
• Contaminated land and water
• Requires active cleanup
• High-risk handling
• Outputs go to Element Archive
• Managed from utility/industrial zones only

The boundary is absolute.

Anti-Obsolescence + Ecology Integration

Source: Final Architectural Mandates; Code of Hope

Integrated principles:

• Extractive mining replaced with purposeful excavation
• Toxins archived rather than buried
• Modular repair reduces long-term waste
• Ecological laws prevent harmful intervention
• Restoration replaces exploitation
• Materials cycle across generations
• Contaminants stored, not dispersed

Anti-obsolescence exists not merely for material systems but for ecological ones.
