MASTER EXTRACTION ANCHOR remains active.
Only extraction. No smoothing. No invention.

Operational Plan (Living System)
Population Structure

Source: Current Operational Plan.md

Approximate population target: ~60 people
A small, multi-generational village.

Population balance is intentional to maintain:
• emotional coherence
• sustainable labor distribution
• authentic intergenerational instruction
• manageable governance

No alternative population numbers are included in the files.

Core Roles Within the Community

Source: Current Operational Plan; Mission/Vision drafts

Anchor
An elder or stabilizing presence.
Provides guidance, emotional steadiness, cultural continuity.

Mentor
Every adult serves as a mentor.
Provides skills training, emotional modeling, and learning pathways.

Contributor
Any member fulfilling community tasks and responsibilities.
Contribution is tied to membership and the Contribution Ethos.

Roles reflect the “full spectrum of the community,” embracing messiness over perfection.

Trauma-Free Environment Mandate

Source: Current Operational Plan; CORE ETHOS & INDEX; Code of Hope

All community operations must uphold a trauma-free environment.

Mandates:
• emotional safety
• conflict resolution through restorative methods
• no coercion
• child protection
• authenticity, truth, and openness
• regulatory oversight by NBI audits
• education designed around emotional regulation

This applies to all ages and every structural module.

Education System (Ages 0–12)

Source: Current Operational Plan.md

The early learning system focuses on:

Sensory experience
Tactile, natural, direct interaction with environment.

Emotional regulation
Based on trauma-free principles and cultural modeling.

Systems thinking
Understanding relationships between people, nature, and tools.

Assessment:
Competence demonstrated through real-world tasks, not tests.
No high-stakes exams.

“Every adult is both a mentor and a continuous learner.”

No files provide curriculum beyond these statements.

Daily Function and Community Flow (Implied Operational Mandates)

Source: Mission/Vision; CORE ETHOS & INDEX

Daily operations are guided by:
• ritual, song, and story
• community meals
• cooperative work
• ecological stewardship
• intergenerational teaching
• restorative justice when conflict appears
• transparency and truthfulness
• belonging as a lived practice

These are cultural-operational rather than legal.

Low-Tech Reliability Constraints

Source: Current Operational Plan; Energy Systems

Technology must be:
• low-impact
• non-lethal
• easily repairable
• grounded in long-term sustainability
• compatible with passive systems

Examples permitted:
• solar
• kinetic capture
• ground-based robotics (maintenance only)

No high-tech dependency is allowed for core life systems.

Operational Architecture Integration

Source: Operational Plan; Architectural Mandates

Operations rely on structural systems:
• closed-loop water
• passive air flow
• internal biomes
• modular life spaces
• ecological restoration principles
• microgrid management
• external remediation separation

Human activities must follow the living/utility separation.

Community Governance in Operations

Source: Governance & Justice.md; Operational Plan

Operations rely on:
• consensus processes
• Stewardship Council coordination
• NBI data and emotional-objectivity audits
• elders as stabilizing anchors
• corrective justice integration
• Contribution Ethos guiding daily involvement

Governance reinforces daily living, not separate from it.

Cultural Operations (Community Identity)

Source: Mission/Vision drafts

Operational culture includes:

Belonging
Stewardship
Purpose
Harmony
Truth

Life expressed through:
• gardens
• forests
• clear waters
• communal tradition (song, fire, storytelling)
• education integrated into daily tasks
• craft and production skills
• respectful technology use

These act as operational norms rather than architectural mandates.

Contribution Ethos in Practice

Source: Code of Hope; Operational Plan

Contribution = participation in:
• ecological restoration
• community labor
• teaching
• mentorship
• resource care
• skill development

Contribution is the operational basis of membership.

Interconnected Ecosystem Operations

Source: Code of Hope; Architectural Mandates

All actions within the operational structure must respect:
• baseline ecological surveys
• non-lethal wildlife methods
• seed preservation for non-native plant removal
• species management through food-source modulation
• internal-external separation of remediation systems

Operations are not solely human—they extend to the land system.
