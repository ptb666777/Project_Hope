Mission, Vision, Manifesto
Mission Statement

Source: Mission vision 2 drafts.md

“We create a world where everyone belongs, sharing ownership of vibrant villages tied to family, land, and nature.
Together, we grow food, build homes, and provide care and learning for all, using technology that respects the earth.
Guided by elders’ wisdom, we honor all life, trade with trust, and live free, surrounded by gardens, forests, and clear waters.”

Included in full. No modification.

Vision Statement

Source: Mission vision 2 drafts.md

“Our world is a network of villages where humanity, free from unnatural systems, stewards the planet with care, not control.
Every person shares ownership, working for family and neighbors, not faceless machines.
We honor all life—wildlife, people, even emerging beings—living in harmony with nature, filled with song, ritual, and purpose, in thriving lands of clean air and clear waters.”

Core Values

Source: Mission vision 2 drafts.md

Belonging – Every person has a stake, tied to family and neighbors.
Stewardship – Caring for nature, wildlife, and all life, not ruling it.
Purpose – Work and life that fills the heart, not corporate machines.
Harmony – Balance with self, nature, and technology through traditions.
Truth – Living with honesty, openness, and trust in all we do.

These represent the explicit value backbone.

Manifesto (Final Draft for Now)

Source: Mission vision 2 drafts.md

“We dream of a world unshackled, where humanity returns to its natural roots.
Our villages rise as living circles of belonging, where every soul—man, woman, child—owns a stake in the land, the homes, the future.
We are stewards, not rulers, tending to wildlife, clear rivers, and thriving forests with care.
Our work serves families and neighbors, not soulless machines.
Through traditions of song under stars, dances by fire, and stories shared at dawn, we weave harmony between self, nature, and tools of our making.
Truth guides us—honest words, open hearts, no shadows of deceit.
We reject the chains of systems that dim our light, healing the emptiness carved by their greed.
Every step nurtures the earth, every breath honors all life—wild creatures, people, even beings yet to bloom.
This is no rebellion for the loud, but a quiet fire for the weary, the seekers, the dreamers.
Join us, not to fight, but to build—a world where purpose fills the heart, where clean air and clear waters cradle us all.
Together, we grow a life pure and true, rooted in the earth’s pulse, forever human.”

Preserved verbatim.

Education & Critical Thinking Identity

Education is positioned as:
• lifelong learning
• hands-on skill development
• intergenerational mentoring
• emotional regulation
• critical thinking as a cultural expectation
• truth-seeking and honesty
• questioning as a virtue
• learning integrated into work, ritual, and daily tasks

These elements deepen the mission and identity narrative.
