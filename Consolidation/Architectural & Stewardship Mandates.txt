MASTER EXTRACTION ANCHOR remains active.
No invention. No smoothing. Only extraction.

Architectural & Stewardship Mandates
Core Sovereignty Mandate: Separation of Functions

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md

The structure must maintain absolute physical separation between:

Life Systems
– Living spaces
– Biomes
– Food systems
– Human activity zones

Utility Systems
– Power generation
– Storage
– Waste handling
– Toxic processing
– External remediation
– Subterranean vaults and tunnels

This separation is non-negotiable and defines the entire architectural logic.

Fragment preserved: “Absolute physical separation” (key phrase).

Mining as Utility (Dual-Purpose Excavation)

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md

Excavation for the PHS lower reservoir and tunnels is a mandated utility operation.
During mining:

Local materials must be intentionally searched for:
• Metals
• Stable stone
• Other resources suitable for integration

These materials become part of the Anti-Obsolescence Economy.

Excavation serves both energy storage and resource generation.

Toxic Containment Requirements

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md

All toxic activity must occur underground, inside the Material Recovery Center (MRC).

Mandates:
• Containment of micro-dust
• Protection from off-gassing
• Zero contamination of internal dome atmosphere
• Full isolation from Life Systems

The MRC handles:
– E-waste breakdown
– Hazardous materials
– Complex recycling processes

No toxic work may occur in living or biome zones.

The Element Archive (No Burial Mandate)

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md

Contaminants processed by the External Bioremediation Hub are:

Separated into pure elemental constituents
Meticulously documented
Stored in hardened subterranean vaults

The Archive serves:
• Education
• Research
• Historical record
• Innovation

Burial of contaminants is forbidden.

Fragment preserved: “No Burial.”

The Remediation Mandate (External Loop)

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md; Code of Hope ecological clauses

All cleaning of external land/water contamination is done in a completely separate external facility.

Rules:
• No external soil or water may enter the dome
• Final toxins from external cleanup go to the Subterranean Utility Vault
• Internal WRC is internal only—no outside fluids or wastes may enter

This protects internal ecological safety and psychological safety.

Closed-Loop Internal Water & Air Systems (Architectural Integration)

Source: Energy & Utility Systems.md; Code of Hope

Internal systems—air, water, waste—must:

Be fully self-contained
Have zero interaction with external ecosystems
Operate within the Life System zones
Be electrically minimal or passive where possible

These systems are part of the architectural backbone.

Subterranean Tunnels & Utility Spine

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md; Energy & Utility Systems

The subterranean tunnel network provides:
– PHS lower reservoir structure
– DC microgrid backbone
– Material Recovery Center
– Element Archive vaults
– Utility-only access paths
– Thermal gradients for passive systems

Tunnels are dedicated to utility functions only.

Anti-Obsolescence Mandates (Structural-Level)

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md; Code of Hope

All structures must:

Be repairable with local materials
Integrate mined resources
Support modular replacement
Avoid proprietary components
Prioritize lifespan measured in centuries

These mandates inform construction materials, schematics, and utility design.

External Bioremediation Hub (Architectural Context)

Source: Final Architectural Mandates.md

This hub is:

External to the dome
Dedicated to environmental cleanup
Linked only via utility pathways
Kept separate from human life areas

Output contaminants go directly to the Element Archive.

Air & Atmosphere Architecture

Source: Energy & Utility Systems.md

Architecture must include:

Passive Bio-Chimney
Uses thermal siphoning
Draws air upward
Filters through living biological system
Operates near zero electricity
Integrates into vertical dome structure

No mechanical forced-air dependency.

Water Architecture

Source: Energy & Utility Systems.md; Final Architectural Mandates

Systems include:

Water Reclamation Cycle (WRC)
Internal-only
Handles blackwater + greywater
Closed loop
Zero interaction with external water

Architecture must ensure containment durability for generations.

Structural Materials

Source: CORE ETHOS & INDEX.md; Operational Plan

Primary structural principles:

Hempcrete
Wood composites
Modular low-tech construction
Durable and easily repairable materials
Compatibility with passive systems and biomes

Internal Biomes & Stewardship Architecture

Source: Current Operational Plan.md

Each biome integrates:
Water
Air
Waste
Ecological restoration principles

Structural design embeds:
Closed-loop systems
Low-tech reliability
Ecological balance laws

Biomes are living architecture, not decoration.

Architectural Fragments (Preserved)

“Zero external water or soil may enter”
“Absolute separation of living and utility functions”
“No burial of contaminants”
“Dual-purpose mining”
“External loop for remediation”
“Contain micro-dust and off-gassing”
“Hardened subterranean vaults”
“Modular, low-tech architecture”
“Passive energy capture systems”
“Water battery tunnels”

Fragments preserved because some are symbolic, others incomplete.
