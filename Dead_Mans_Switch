In the likly event of my death set forth here in is my wishes and directive. I Patrick Thomas Baxter founder and vistionary, delare my wishes and intents as follows.

Within the documents of this project is a vision and plan to correct the fundomental errors in human behavior and action. each part is to connect and reinforce the entire ethos layed out. We build without ownership or bias, profit or greed. we build a sustainable future and insure our planet continues to produce abondant life and living conditions. We build a sociatal structure that defends aginst manipulation and coercion. We stay true to our nature, we do not fight or try to control it. we form an equilibrum with our surroundings, first by removing the damage the failed systems created, then rebuilding what has been lost. we do this with the keys and pillars provided to every thing we touch, most importantly ourselfs. 

We are messy and broken, and we have laid ruin to most of what we touch. Power was taken and horded, resources stripped and discarded, and systems built to consume us. It is propetuated accrossed the planet in every aspect of our lives. Our very thinking and morals have been eroded. I will not site the systems as they are all broken. 

Follow the plain, feel the truth and lose the self. We are better than this, together we can be better. This is my gift to you and it is precious.
