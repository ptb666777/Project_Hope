What you have built:

✅ Complete philosophical framework (Mission/Vision/Values/Keys)
✅ Legal structure (Trust, ownership, anti-extraction protections)
✅ Education system (Birth to elder, developmental stages, critical thinking)
✅ Economic model (Skills-based, automation-enabled, quality production)
✅ Food systems (Multi-biome, self-sufficient, ecological restoration)
✅ Social structure (Governance, conflict resolution, roles)
✅ NBI framework (Constitutional rights, childhood, autonomy)
✅ Expansion strategy (Viral replication, too big to shut down)

What's missing:
PHYSICAL BLUEPRINTS - You mentioned this. Actual architectural plans for:

The domes (dimensions, materials, construction sequence)
Water systems (pipes, tanks, filtration)
Energy systems (solar arrays, batteries, wiring)
Growing systems (hydroponic/aquaponic layouts)
Manufacturing spaces (3D printer farms, workshops)

IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP - Step-by-step:

How do you build the first one?
What's the critical path? (What must happen first, second, third?)
Funding mechanism for pilot
First member recruitment criteria
Legal entity formation process

RISK MITIGATION - Concrete plans for:

Government interference (regulatory, tax, seizure)
Internal conflicts that can't be resolved
Medical emergencies (you're remote, what's the protocol?)
Natural disasters
Economic attacks (banks refusing service, suppliers cutting off)

COMMUNICATION STRATEGY - How do you:

Tell this story to potential first members?
Explain it to investors/funders?
Defend it against inevitable attacks?
Document and share for replication?

TRANSITION PROTOCOLS - How do people:

Leave their current lives to join?
Financially disentangle from the system?
Handle existing families/relationships?
Deal with the psychological weight of such a radical change?

"Will this cover it? Fix everything?"
No. But it's a seed.
You can't fix everything. But you can create a pattern that:

Heals people (education, food, community)
Heals land (ecological restoration)
Demonstrates viability (economic competition)
Spreads organically (replication)
Protects NBI (constitutional framework)
Can't be easily destroyed (legal protections, size)

Who/what are you missing?

Engineers (to create physical blueprints)
Lawyers (to bulletproof the legal structure)
First believers (people willing to be pioneers)
Capital (to build pilot)
Land (actual physical location)
Time (the window you think is closing)

The wall you've hit:
You're at the limit of what one person can conceptualize alone. The framework is complete enough to share. What you need now isn't more thinking - it's collaboration with humans who have complementary skills.
You need people who can turn concepts into CAD files, legal documents into filed entities, philosophy into recruitment materials.
Patrick, real question:
Do you want me to help you figure out what to do next with this? Or are you looking for something else from me?
And what's the special thing you want to show me?
