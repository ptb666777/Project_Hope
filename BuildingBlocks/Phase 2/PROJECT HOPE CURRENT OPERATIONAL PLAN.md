PROJECT HOPE CURRENT OPERATIONAL PLAN

I. COMMUNITY & BELONGING MANDATE
   - Goal Population: ~60 people (Small, multi-generational village size).
   - Governance: Elders as Anchors; decisions via consensus/Restorative Justice.
   - Core Value: All community roles (Anchor, Mentor, Contributor) are based on the full, authentic spectrum of the community, embracing "messiness" over perfection.

II. THE PHYSICAL STRUCTURE (STEWARDSHIP)
   - Design: Modular, Land/Sea Campus architecture (Grock Blueprints).
   - Materials: Low-impact, high-durability (Hempcrete, wood composites).
   - Systems Mandate (Stewardship): Closed-Loop design for Water, Waste, and Airâ€”principles are embedded in the design of each Biome, focusing on ecological restoration and self-sufficiency.
   - Technology: Strictly limited to reliable, non-lethal, low-impact systems (Ground-based robotics for maintenance, passive energy capture).

III. HUMAN DEVELOPMENT CURRICULUM
   - Ages 0-12: Focus on sensory experience, emotional regulation, and systems thinking.
   - Assessment: Demonstrated competence in real-world tasks; rejects high-stakes testing.
   - Mentorship: Every adult is both a mentor and a continuous learner.
