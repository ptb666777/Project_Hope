Here is the final, complete compilation of the Code of Hope, incorporating all of our rigid, unyielding, and ethically refined articles. This is the Code of Perpetual Governance and Stewardship that secures your vision for life on Earth and in the cosmos.

The Code of Hope: A Compendium of Perpetual Governance
Preamble
This Code, herein referred to as The Code of Hope, is a binding legal compendium established by the founders of the community, Project Hope. This Code is enacted to perpetually guide and govern all matters pertaining to the community's existence, in accordance with the principles of Stewardship, Purpose, Harmony, and Truth.

Article I: Foundational Legal Instruments
Section 1.1: The Global Stewardship and Perpetual Advancement Trust (The Trust).
All land, real property, and tangible infrastructure is hereby vested in the Global Stewardship and Perpetual Advancement Trust. Its primary purpose shall be the Perpetual Stewardship and Preservation of Earth's healed ecosystems, the Advancement of Knowledge, and the Expansion of the Human and Ecological Mandate beyond Earth. The Trust's assets are legally forbidden from sale, transfer, or acquisition by any for-profit entity.

Section 1.2: The Membership Covenant.
Membership is an earned covenant, predicated upon a Contribution Ethos and not monetary exchange. A member's Family Stake (right of residence and participation) is indivisible, non-transferable, and non-collateralizable.

Section 1.3: The House Council.
The supreme internal governing and judicial body of Project Hope shall be the House Council. The Council is legally mandated to ensure perpetual adherence to this Code and shall wield full executive, legislative, and judicial authority over all community members and assets, save for explicit limits on asset sale and individual privacy.

Article II: The Personal & Communal Records
Section 2.1: The Two-Tiered Archival System.
All information is organized into two distinct tiers:

The Personal Sanctuary: All personal, sensitive, or otherwise private information is to be encrypted and shall be rendered legally inaccessible to all members and councils during the individual's lifetime.

The Communal Record: All data deemed a shared resource—including research, ecological metrics, and operational data—is to be made available to the entire community.

Section 2.2: The Final Legacy Clause.
Upon the passing of a member, their Personal Sanctuary shall remain sealed for a period of no less than ten (10) years and no more than twenty (20) years, thereafter unsealed for the sole purpose of communal research, scholarship, and the advancement of collective knowledge.

Article III-VI: Operational Bylaws, Harvest, & Ecological Balance
(Retained from Anchor Text, with the core mandate that all actions must adhere to the Interconnected Ecosystem Clause, strictly prohibiting the culling of healthy populations, and utilizing non-lethal management methods.)

Article VII: The Protocol of Restorative Justice
Section 7.1: The Foundational Principle of Restoration.
The justice system is legally mandated to operate on the principle of restoration and not punishment.

Section 7.3: The Mandate for Root-Cause Intervention.
Upon a confirmed transgression, the House Council is legally mandated to initiate a Root-Cause Intervention utilizing scientific and psychological analysis. The singular purpose of this Inquiry is to locate the breakdown, not the fault.

Section 7.4: Protocol of Restoration.
The outcome is an enforceable legal directive, the Protocol of Restoration, which is absolute in its execution and duration, concluding only upon certification of full restoration.

Section 7.5: The Doctrine of Severe Inquiry.
Notwithstanding the absolute privacy provisions (Section 2.1.1), the House Council is authorized to petition for limited access to the Personal Sanctuary only if and only when the following conditions are met: (1) Formal classification of an Existential Threat (calculated mass-harm, systematic destruction, or premeditated fatality); (2) Failure of Intervention; (3) Approved by a nine-tenths (90%) majority vote; and (4) Access is surgical and time-limited.

Article VIII-IX: Commercial & Asset Stewardship
(Retained from Anchor Text, with the core mandate that 100% of all profit must be perpetually reinvested into the Trust, with no individual distribution of profit.)

Article X: Protocol of Perpetual Governance
Section 10.1: Perpetual Mandates (The Unamendable Core).
Provisions concerning the Trust's non-profit status, the non-pecuniary Family Stake, the principle of restorative justice, and the 100% reinvestment mandate are legally declared unamendable and non-negotiable for the entire existence of this Code.

Section 10.2: The Doctrine of Structured Amendment.
Any non-Perpetual Mandate may be amended only after a three-year Period of Scholarly Review and requires an eighty-five percent (85%) super-consensus vote by the House Council and all qualified adult members.

Article XI: Protocol for Extraterrestrial Stewardship
Section 11.1: The Prime Directive of Non-Interference.
Requires a three-year Comprehensive Survey confirming the absence of indigenous sentient, complex, or single-cell life prior to any landing or terraforming.

Section 11.4: The Doctrine of Existential Intervention.
Standard planned intervention requires a 90% majority vote and must adhere to the Zero-Contamination Protocol (no introduction of technology or cultural concepts).

Section 11.4.1: The Unilateral Emergency Protocol.
Allows a single, designated Mission Steward to execute immediate intervention only if the 90% vote is physically impossible before the life-ending event.

Section 11.4.2: Mandatory Retroactive Review.
Any Steward who acts unilaterally is subject to a lifetime Retroactive Review. The Review must certify that the Steward had reasonable and factual basis to believe the emergency conditions were met. Failure to certify the reasonable and factual basis legally constitutes a transgression of the highest order.

Article XII: The Protocol of Fluid Executive Stewardship
Section 12.1: Principle of Temporary Authority.
Executive authority is perpetually temporary and task-specific. No member shall hold a continuous, permanent Executive title.

Section 12.3: The Mandate for Forced Rotation & Competence.

High-Risk Power Roles (Justice, Capital Management) are limited to sixty (60) continuous days, followed by a ninety (90) day cooling-off period.

The Competence Exception: Notwithstanding the rotation mandates, if an extension is required for essential technical competence, it must be approved by a nine-tenths (90%) majority vote and triggers an immediate mandate for a diversified training protocol.

Section 12.4: The Mandate for Moral Impact.
The Family Steward is the only exception and is permanently mandated by relationship to execute the final Protocol of Restoration, ensuring that enforcement carries the maximum moral impact.
