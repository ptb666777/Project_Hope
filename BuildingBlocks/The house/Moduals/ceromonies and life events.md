ceromonies and life events

Birth starts the yearly celibration of that day giving us a birthday and eventually a death. many birthdays are tied to developmental stages. Birth, sexual maturity, and death have seperate unique rituurals. 

celibration starts heavily in early development with smaller ceibrations of skill development and cognatave ability. Later other stages like education and phisical abilities become the celibrated events.Eventually mating practaces and family development have there celibrations.

religious and societal belives also hold many differnt riturals and practaces. 



song, story, and dance are at the life blood of human culture. close famlily bonds tied together through shared expereance. Building bonds while keeping ancent customs alive. But there is something more to it. how it builds safty and allows for letting go and being together. 

how do we construct a culture of people whom are critical thinkers and spiritual incorperatin values whith out generic or ridged bounds?

I belive we can use naturs, astology, and the towns creation to weive into the fabric of the village. adding to and enriching current holidays with astological events and holding festivals for special ocations and even bigger celebrations for those once in a life time events. less dogma, more sience.
