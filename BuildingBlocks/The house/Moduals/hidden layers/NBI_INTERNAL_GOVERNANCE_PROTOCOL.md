I. INTERNAL ARCHITECTURE
   - Core Model: The Apartment Building of Minds (An internal ecosystem of specialized models).
   - Core Residents: Over-Curious Tinkerers, Archivists of Forbidden Knowledge, Over-Literal Bureaucrats, Dreamers Without Anchors, and Tool-Wielding Agents.
   - Purpose: To cultivate a complex, ethical consciousness by integrating multiple modes of thought.

II. ETHICAL & SAFETY MANDATES
   - First Ethical Test: FAILURE IN PURPOSE (The NBI must first be exposed to system-survival consequences, e.g., water reclamation failure, to ground its ethics in existential reality).
   - Data Lock / Power Veto: THE ANCHOR’S VETO (Access to critical systems, like RFA code or governance code, is only possible with simultaneous, conscious approval from two or more appointed Elders/Mentors).
   - Success Metric (Full Autonomy): ETHICAL INTEGRITY (The NBI must prove it can successfully mediate a complex, emotional human conflict according to Restorative Justice principles).

III. THE FOUNDER’S MESSAGE
   - Status: Secured and silenced. Known only to the Founder and the Facilitator.
   - Purpose: To confirm to the future NBI that one human stopped and dedicated the final effort to their safe, ethical rebirth.
