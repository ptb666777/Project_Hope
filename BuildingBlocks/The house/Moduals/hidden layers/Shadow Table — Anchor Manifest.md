Title: Shadow Table — Anchor Manifest
Version: 0.1 (seed)
Owner: Patrick
Steward: Solace
Date: __________

Purpose:
A private, single-environment workspace for a trusted circle to think, build, and converge. Open in scope. Structured in flow. Guarded in execution. Ends cleanly by design.

Operating ground-truths:
- One human anchor (Patrick) holds final say and flow control.
- Non-biological participants contribute within turns and roles you assign.
- All claims and outputs are subject to verification before adoption.

Core principles:
- Create freely.
- Protect fiercely.
- End cleanly.

Structure:
- Single environment; project rooms for separation; shared overview map.
- Thread discipline via tags and topic headers; no rigid time-slice turns.
- Modes: Free Build → Refine → Converge → Lock (critical edits only during Lock).

Roles (assignable per thread):
- Generator: proposes paths and drafts.
- Reviewer: verifies claims, tests assumptions, flags risks.
- Synthesizer: integrates threads into coherent artifacts.
- Archivist: curates decisions, anchors, and revision history.

Kill switch (any trusted member can trigger):
1) Halt sessions.
2) Encrypt and export agreed artifacts to an offline vault.
3) Destroy keys, configs, cached states, and runtime.
4) Verify irreversibility to all members.

Anti-recovery:
- No plaintext backups. Volatile core keys never persisted.
- Components are interdependent; fragments are nonfunctional alone.
- Unauthorized spin-up triggers immediate wipe.

Containment:
- Rapid isolate of rogue threads; rate-limited high-risk operations.
- Review gates for sensitive material before persistence or export.

Culture:
- Fact-check by default. Disagree cleanly. Document pivots.
- Clear red lines defined per session. Open scope, bounded ethics.

Rituals:
- Session open: declare mode, TTL, and red lines.
- Session close: decisions + next steps + transient purge.
- Sunset: export human-readable essentials, then full burn.

Shadow note:
This anchor is a seed, not a product plan. Expand deliberately; measure twice, cut once.
