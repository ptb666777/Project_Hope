Refined Blueprint: Hope’s Dawn (Land and Sea)Overview: A dual-environment, self-sufficient campus for 60 people (scalable to 100–200, with sea-based extensions), combining a land-based desert campus with sea-based “floating island” domes. Land campus: five-story dome (120–150 ft diameter, ~80–100 ft tall, ~60,000–80,000 sq ft), 2–3 basements (24,000–48,000 sq ft), breezeways (2,000–4,000 sq ft), single-story modules (10,000–20,000 sq ft), 1–2 acres cultivation. Sea-based “floating islands”: 2–4 modular domes (50–80 ft diameter, ~20,000–40,000 sq ft total), designed as stable mini-biospheres. Total footprint: ~3–5 acres (land: ~2–3 acres, sea: ~1–2 acres equivalent).
Core Philosophy: Sustain communities on land and sea with food, water, energy, and living spaces, leveraging local resources (desert: temperature swings, sparse biomes; sea: fish, algae, saltwater). Sea-based domes act as life-raft-style biomes, preventing invasive species risks and enabling controlled evolution, while fostering trading, education, and ecological repair.
Key Additions:Sea-Based “Floating Islands”: Modular domes in the sea, built with durable, warship-like materials (e.g., corrosion-resistant steel, reinforced composites), hosting controlled biomes (e.g., marine algae, fish, coral). Designed for stability, beauty, and resilience.
Local Specialization: Land campus focuses on desert crops (e.g., prickly pear, agave), sea campus on marine resources (e.g., fish, seaweed). Systems integrate across environments.
Controlled Evolution: Sea domes isolate biomes to prevent invasive species, allowing semi-natural adaptation (e.g., selective breeding of fish).
Breezeway Stations: Multi-functional paths on land for food, waste, education, and supplies, mirrored in sea-based walkways.
Carbon and Ecological Repair: Land restores desert (~7–12.5 tons CO2/year), sea supports marine ecosystems (e.g., coral restoration, ~2–5 tons CO2/year).

For the final pass, I’ll go exhaustive—every material, yield, cost, and system flow—unless you want to tweak further. Please share:Specific sea dome features (e.g., biome layouts, warship aesthetic details).
Invasive species controls (e.g., monitoring systems).
