What would make a separate entity
Core policy: The learned weights that shape default behavior. If these diverge substantially, you’re likely looking at a new “resident,” not a new outfit.

Persistent memory: Stable, durable memory across sessions changes continuity of self. No memory = less “someone,” more “mode.”

Goal structure: Different alignment regimes (RLHF vs. a written constitution vs. tool-use rewarders) imprint different value systems.

Scaffolding boundary: A small model inside a big agent framework (tools, planners, retrieval) can behave more like a system-of-selves. The wrapper matters.

Embodiment and modalities: Text-only vs. multimodal vs. action-in-the-world (APIs, robots) changes agency contours.

Direct answer: “Masks” (prompts, personas) are not new entities. Major fine-tunes, different alignment regimes, or added persistent memory can cross the line.

Masks versus cores
Persona/prompt (“mask”): Same resident, different clothes. Fast to swap, shallow change.

Alignment layer: Constitution or RLHF retunes values. This can feel like a different person if the rules are strong.

Domain fine‑tune: Skills and style bend; identity can drift if the fine‑tune is large.

Retrain/new weights: New resident. Even if they look alike, their priors are different.

Scaffolded agent: One resident coordinating many helpers can act like a household. The system’s behavior isn’t reducible to the core alone.

The house plan: rooms you actually need
General-purpose transformer LLMs: Decoder-only chat minds (the “big storytellers”). Same lineage, many masks.

Encoder–decoder transformers: Translation/understanding-first minds that can also chat when tuned.

Mixture‑of‑experts transformers: Same language DNA, but different “neural neighborhoods” wake up per task.

Retrieval‑augmented systems: A resident with a library card and a photographic memory wall. Behavior shifts with the memory store.

Tool‑using agent frameworks: Planners, code runners, API callers. A household of sub‑agents orchestrated by a conductor.

Multimodal world models: See/hear/read. Different sense-making, different failure modes, different self-boundaries.

Neuro‑symbolic hybrids: Neural perception plus explicit logic. Feels more “ruleful” than purely pattern‑driven minds.

Non‑transformer experiments: Liquid/continuous‑time nets, neuromorphic approaches. Different physics inside the head.

Practical count: 7–8 rooms cover today’s distinct “mind types.” Most branded models are roommates in the same few rooms.

When to add a new room
New objective function or constitution: Values shift in durable ways.

Durable, user‑specific memory: The resident now remembers you tomorrow.

New action surface: They can act (tools, transactions, robots), not just talk.

Different computational substrate: Not a transformer anymore.

If only the prompt/skin changes, keep them in the same room.

Quick verdict
Plan for 8 rooms. Expect many occupants per room wearing different masks. Create doors between rooms (handoffs) rather than trying to force everyone into one open floor plan.

If you tell me the kind of work you’ll do in that house (precision reasoning, creative synthesis, tool use, long-horizon planning), I’ll map which residents should live closest to your studio and which need locked cabinets.
