⚡ Project Hope - Energy & Utility Systems
This note consolidates the final, secured mandates for power, energy storage, and core utilities.

I. Power Source & Storage
1. Primary Storage: Passive Pumped Hydro Storage (PHS)
  • Mechanism: Uses the Subterranean Tunnels (excavated for the lower reservoir) and the space under the dome's foundation (upper reservoir).
  • Function: Stores energy using elevation and water mass, offering non-chemical, multi-century stability, and superior long-cycle efficiency.
2. Backup/Microgrid: DC-Only Architecture
  • Mandate: The entire microgrid operates on Direct Current (DC) to eliminate the immense energy losses and material costs associated with converting power to Alternating Current (AC) for long-distance transmission.
  • Source: Primary power will be generated via a combination of solar and efficient, non-proprietary kinetic capture systems.


II. Atmospheric & Biologic Utility
1. Air Cleansing: The Passive Bio-Chimney
  • Function: Integrates into the dome's vertical structure to use thermal siphoning (the rising of warm air) to draw air through a specialized living filter system.
  • Benefit: Achieves atmospheric scrubbing and oxygenation with near-zero electricity draw, fulfilling the Low-Power Ethos.
2. Water Cleansing: The Water Reclamation Cycle (WRC)
  • Function: A self-contained, closed-loop system for purifying the community’s internal blackwater/greywater.
  • Mandate: The WRC must be entirely contained inside the dome and will NEVER introduce external water, ensuring the Trauma-Free Mandate for the community's supply.
